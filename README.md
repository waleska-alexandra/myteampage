This was an great challenge for newbie front end developer like me. Obviously, if you have many experience, this one could be very easy and unnecessary. I was able to improve things like responsive design and I had my first meet with Figma. I think this was a great opportunity. I finished this project with more knowledge about HTML and CSS.
